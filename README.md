# MERN Book Search Engine

## Description

The purpose of this project is to take a fully functional Google Books API search engine built with RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. In this project I was able to set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify the data.  

## Installation

In order to use this project you have to run an npm install and an npm run develop.  After these commands the application will be functional in the desired environment.  

## Usage

After installing the application the user will first need to sign up for an account and then will need to login in order to search for books through the google books API. Once the user has signed up and successfully logged in the search engine will now be functional.  When the user searches for books a list of matches will be displayed and the results will be returned to the main page.  From there you can now save books into the see your books page.  On this page you can now view the list of books you saved and can also delete books you no longer wish to have.
